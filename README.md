# TodayOnScience

Simple web scrapping application that collects article information (title, link and image) to store on a sqlite3 database.

Sites used for scrapping:
http://www.sci-news.com,
https://www.sciencenews.org,
https://www.universetoday.com,
https://spaceflightnow.com.

How to use? 

TodayOnScience needs ChromeDriver (and Chrome) to work:
https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
The .sqlite3 database file will be created on the directory "C:\Users\(User)\Documents\TodayOnScience".

I included a .jar file for testing purposes on the folder "\out\artifacts\TodayOnScience_jar".

Suggestions are appreciated :)
